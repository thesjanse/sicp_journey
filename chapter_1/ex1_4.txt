Exercise 1.4.
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for
combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))


For the expression (_ a b) the operator is defined by the sign of b operand.
If it's positive then it's the regular sum.
If it's negative then a minus -b, which equals to the sum of the expression.
